## NOTICE

1. This repository is a fork and most of it is not mine. Credit to @penguinify for the original repo.

2. A recent update to ChromeOS (v115/v116) released in August 2023 has blocked all javascript: and javascript:// bookmarklets. If you use a managed Chromebook and **Devtools are turned off** (that means Inspect element, etc.) (they must be turned off or bookmarklets still work) then the Car Axle Client Bookmarklet won't work. You can still use an [about:blank Injector however](https://disnos9.github.io/jsinject/) but some features won't work. (Things like history flooder, scripts, etc.)

## Features

-   Exploits and history flooder
-   Small, fun things bookmarklets
-   Large 300+ game library
-   JS Console
-   Mini Browser
-   Youtube Embeder
-   Scripts that improve your quality of life
